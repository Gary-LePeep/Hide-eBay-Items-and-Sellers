# Privacy Policy for easyBlock: Hide Items, Sellers, Sponsored, and More

#### Effective Date: October 7, 2024

The developers of *easyBlock: Hide Items, Sellers, Sponsored, and More* ("easyBlock"), we value your privacy and are committed to protecting any data that we collect from you through your use of our browser extension.

### 1. Information We Collect

easyBlock does not collect, store, or share any personal information from users. All data related to hidden items or blocked sellers is stored locally on your browser's storage and is never transmitted to our servers or any third-party services, except for the purpose of syncing data across devices using the same browser and account.

### 2. Data Storage and Synchronization

easyBlock utilizes your browser's storage to keep track of hidden items and blocked sellers. If your browser supports and your account is enabled for cloud synchronization, this data may be synced across devices using the same browser account. This synchronization is handled entirely by the browser, and we do not have access to this data.

### 3. Permissions

easyBlock requires certain permissions to function properly, such as:

- Access to the websites you visit (e.g., eBay, Amazon) to allow for processing specific to the websites.
- Access to your browser's storage for saving your hidden items, blocked sellers, and other settings.
- Access to your tabs for reloading them and checking when loading is finished.

We do not use these permissions to collect or transmit any personally identifiable information.

### 4. Third-Party Services

This extension does not integrate with any third-party services, meaning no external data collection or tracking is performed.

### 5. Changes to the Policy

We reserve the right to update this privacy policy. Any changes will be reflected here, and we encourage you to review this policy periodically.

### 6. Contact Us

If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please reach out to us via our GitHub repository or by [emailing us](mailto:n7bvdoj73@mozmail.com).

<sub>By using this extension, you agree to the terms of this privacy policy. You also agree that you will not use easyBlock for any purposes prohibited by United States law, including, without limitation, the development, design, manufacture or production of nuclear, missiles, or chemical or biological weapons.</sub>
